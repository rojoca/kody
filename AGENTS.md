# kody agent index

Instructions for **agents and humans working in this repository** (building and
maintaining Kody). End-user / MCP usage docs live under
[`docs/use/`](./docs/use/index.md).

Kody is a multi-user personal assistant: every signed-in user gets a fully
isolated assistant (own packages, jobs, secrets, values, memories, chat threads,
remote connectors, email inboxes, durable storage). When adding code, every
read/write path must be scoped by `userId`, every Durable Object id that backs
user-owned state must be namespaced by `userId`, and every search/vector path
must filter by `userId`. Cross-user data sharing is a bug.

Use Node 24 and npm for installs and scripts (`npm install`, `npm run ...`).

## Validation contract

`npm run validate` is the single authoritative gate. It is read-only and runs
the same checks CI runs — in fact CI invokes `npm run validate` literally. If
`npm run validate` passes locally, CI will pass; if CI fails despite a green
local `validate`, that is a bug in `validate` and should be filed.

- `npm run validate` runs `format:check`, `lint`, `docs:check-temporal`,
  `typecheck`, unit tests, Playwright E2E, and MCP E2E in parallel and reports
  every failure (it does not abort sibling checks on the first failure).
- `npm run validate:fix` is the explicit opt-in for mutating auto-fixes
  (`format` + `lint:fix`). Running it is never required to pass `validate`.
- The Husky `pre-commit` and `pre-push` hooks remain narrower fast gates; they
  are not a substitute for `validate`.

This file is intentionally brief. Detailed instructions live in focused docs:

- Contributor documentation map:
  [docs/contributing/index.md](./docs/contributing/index.md)
- Documentation principles (usage vs contributing, MCP text, gardening):
  [docs/contributing/documentation.md](./docs/contributing/documentation.md)
- Commit-time formatting, linting, and typechecking are enforced by Husky +
  lint-staged; see `docs/contributing/setup.md` for the workflow details and
  what needs explicit validation.
